# fairworkflows-evaluation
This repository contains materials for evaluation of the fairworkflows library

This user study aims to evaluate the usability of FAIRWorkflows. Users were asked to perform the following tasks.
### Preliminary Task 1:
* Simple use of existing / published steps 
* Objective: Learn how to use the defined steps
### Preliminary Task 2:
* Use an existing workflow 
* Objective: Learn how to use the defined workflow
### Preliminary Task 3:
* Define your own workflow 
* Objective: How to define a workflow from published steps
## Task :
* Compose a workflow from published steps to perform a task 
* Objective: Reuse existing steps / commands to compose a workflow

* The participants will be asked to compose a workflow to accomplish different image-editing tasks.
* In each task, a target image will be given and participants will create a workflow (involving 3-5 steps) that would produce this image from the input image.  
* 3 different image editing workflows
* Using 10 steps: 
   + Draw rectangle
   + Change brightness / contrast
   + Adjust opacity / mode
   + Desaturate image
   + Invert image
   + Blur image with Gaussian smoothing
   + Convert RGB image to grayscale 
   + Add a text into the image 
   + Segment an object from the background image
   + Add a background image to the segmented image
